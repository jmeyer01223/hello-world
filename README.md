# hello-world
My first repository
I am interested in learning more about programming beacuase of an AP computer science classs I took.
This class taught me the basics of coding in Java, and I am interested in learning new languages and new ways to use programming.
In the future, I would like to be able to apply what I have learned about computer science and programming to projects in the real world. Primarlity, I am interested in applications related to business (my intended major in college).
